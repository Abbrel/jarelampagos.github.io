I am a postgraduate researcher at Lancaster University and a member of the Space and Planetary Physics Research Group. 
My research focuses on the structure and dynamics of the Earth's magnetosphere, with a particular focus on its interactions with the solar wind and the ionosphere. I use a combination of in situ spacecraft observations and ground-based instruments such as SuperDARN (Super Dual Auroral Radar Network) to gain a better understanding of the interplay between the magnetosphere, the ionosphere and the influence of solar wind-driven processes.

Other research interests include:
- Magnetospheric Physics including magnetic reconnection processes at the magnetotail.
- Auroral Physics and its formation mechanisms. 
- Ionosphere-Magnetosphere interactions, particularly plasma convection, the existence of dusk-dawn asymmetries, and substorm dynamics.
- Space Plasma Physics. 

Aside from my research, I am keen to share what I learn and have taken part in outreach events and talks to make space science more accessible to a wider audience.
